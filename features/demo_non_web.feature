Feature: Showcase the simplest possible Cucumber scenario
  In order to verify that cucumber is installed and configured correctly
  As an aspiring BDD fanatic
  I should be able to run this scenario and see that the steps pass (green like a cuke)

Scenario: Cutting vegetables
  Given a cucumber that is 30 cm long
  When I cut it in halves
  Then I have two cucumbers
  And both are 15 cm long
