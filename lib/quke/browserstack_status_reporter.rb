  # Used to update the status of a session in Browserstack to mark it as passed
  # or failed. It does this by making a PUT request to Browserstack's REST API
  # requesting the status of a specified session is set to 'passed' or 'failed'
  # (only those values are accepted).

  #
  # A session ID is only available when we configure Quke to work with
  # Browserstack, and can only be obtained when in the context of running a
  # scenario. It's unique to the overall session (it doesn't change for each
  # scenario or feature), but we have to set it as a global variable in
  # after_hook.rb in order to access it in the after_exit block in env.rb
